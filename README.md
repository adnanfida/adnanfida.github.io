## Evaluation Framework

This project includes an evaluation framework designed to assess the quality of search results.

### Key Components:

*   **`evaluator.py`**: Contains functions for loading search results from JSON files, calculating relevance, and determining result quality.
*   **`reporting.py`**: Provides a `Report` class to store and display evaluation metrics.
*   **`utils.py`**: Offers utility functions for file operations.

### Functionality:

1.  **Data Loading**: `evaluator.py` handles loading search results.
2.  **Relevance and Quality Calculation**: `evaluator.py` includes placeholder functions for calculating result relevance and quality.
3.  **Reporting**: `reporting.py`'s `Report` class stores and displays evaluation metrics.

### Usage:

This framework helps evaluate search algorithm or system performance by loading search results and generating a report with relevance and quality scores.

### Tests

The `tests` directory contains unit tests for the project. These tests ensure the core components of the project function as expected.

#### Setup

To run the tests, ensure you have `unittest` installed. Most Python environments come with it pre-installed. If not, you can install it using `pip install unittest`.

#### Execution

1. Navigate to the root directory of the project.
